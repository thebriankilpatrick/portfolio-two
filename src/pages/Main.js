// Want to have a screen-sized 'landing' image, that will fit any size of screen
// This 'image' will have some sort of cool CSS effect, and will have my name, and what I do in the center
// The user could either click 'Learn More', or just scroll.
// Clicking 'Learn More' will have a JS scroll effect to bring the user to the about me section
// Unless I can get a good picture of myself, I probably will not have a picture on the site.
// I will probably have those 'icon' things with some of the regular tech terminology
// Will need to find a unique way to list the projects I have done.
// Then, further down, the contact portion.  And possibly, a button to go back to the top.
